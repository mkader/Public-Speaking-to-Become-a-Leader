        1. List your fears
            * Take a few minutes to list any fears you have about public speaking.
            * What's your worst nightmare? Which scenario scares you the most?
            * Then, think of solutions to mitigate the risks of this scenario occurring.
            * For example, if you are afraid of forgetting your content. One solution might be to keep your notes with you during your presentation.
            * If you are afraid of not knowing how to answer the questions. Prepare your answer in advance in case an audience member asks you a difficult question. You can say :
            * “I don't know the answer, but I'll find it and get back to you. When can I call you to discuss it?"
            * “I haven’t looked at that aspect yet. I note this point and come back to you during the day, is that ok with you?"
            * "That's a very good question. I don't know the answer, but I know who can help me to answer you. I'll send you an email after the presentation."
        2. Define the ideal scenario for your presentation
            * Are you presenting a product and you want your customers to sign with you at the end of your presentation?
            * Do you present a project and want your audience to applaud you at the end?
            * Are you presenting an idea and you want your manager to approve it?
            * Visualize the ideal scenario mentally to prepare yourself. Imagine yourself presenting and everything going your way. Add colors, light, sounds, applause and above all feel the emotions you will have during your presentation.
            * What emotion do you want to feel? Pride, courage, confidence, determination or joy?
* Prepare the ground
    1. What is your message?
    5. [Exercise] what is your goal?
        * Before you start creating your slides. It is important to clarify the purpose of your presentation. What do you want to accomplish with your presentation?

    6. Who is your audience?
    7. [Exercise] Who is your audience?
        * Before you jump into creating your presentation, be clear about some characteristics of the members in your audience.
            1. Age
            1. Position or function
            1. Level of detail appreciated

        * All these elements influence your presentation, and you must take them into account.
        * The clearer you are about these elements, the more your presentation will be adapted to the needs of your audience.
    8. Choose the style of your presentation
    9. [Exercise] Choose the style of your presentation
        * We have just seen together that there are two main ways to prepare a presentation. Either you list the important points and you improvise the rest. Or, you write your entire script word for word.
        * Each of these methods has its advantages and disadvantages.
        * The method that works best is the one that makes you most comfortable.
        * Thinking about a presentation you have to give in the coming days or weeks, which method best suits the context of your presentation? Informal presentation or rather a scripted presentation at TEDx?
        * In the past, have you given your presentations by writing your entire speech? Or do you usually just list the important points and improvise the rest? How did you feel with each of these methods?
        * It is really important for you to discover the method that makes you most comfortable.
    10. The environment of your presentation
* Structure your presentation
    1. Capture the attention of your audience
    12. [Exercise] How to capture the attention of your audience
        * I encourage you to take a few minutes to think of questions you can ask at the start of your presentation to grab the attention of your audience members and spark their curiosity.
        * These questions should be brief and announce the benefits your audience will derive from your presentation.
        * I suggest that you limit the number of questions to 3 to capture attention.
        * You can also start your presentation by:
            1. An intriguing statistic like "Do you know that 120 websites are hacked every second in the world?"
            1. A brief anecdote that announces the subject of your presentation
            1. Or a question/riddle, and you promise the solution at the end of the presentation. For example "Do you know the difference between a computer and a dolphin?"
        * The goal is to arouse curiosity and capture attention at the same time.
